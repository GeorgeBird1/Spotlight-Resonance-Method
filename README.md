# Spotlight-Resonance-Method
Code implementation of the Spotlight Resonance Method. This is implemented in Numpy, but can be easily adapted to Torch, Tensorflow or alternative.

SpotlightResonanceMethod.py contains a function for computing spotlight resonance on a given array.
Example.pynb contains an example of how to use the Spotlight Resonance Method using a randomly generate numpy array with various anisotropies introduced.
